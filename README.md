# Widget Apparel

An e-commerce store for trendy fashion

## Why I built this:
This project is built to take a deep dive into [React](https://reactjs.org/) and how to build applications using [React](https://reactjs.org/).

## What else other than [React](https://reactjs.org/)?

### [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

Since the project is focused on learning React,Firebase was used
for backend and database handling to keep focus on React fundamentals. Firebase
also allows for simple OAuth implementation for the e-store. 

### [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)

Using Redux library to manage and centralize the applications state.

### [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)

Stripe integration to handle credit card payments. This is a mock website that does not 
sell real products so the stripe integration does not take real payments.
Will possibly build small backend to handle "real" payment requests in the future, but will still not accept real payments.
